## Local Development

To run this site locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. **Important**: You must serve the files through a local web server rather than opening them directly as files. This is because the site uses fetch requests to load the markdown files, which don't work with the `file://` protocol due to browser security restrictions.

You can use one of these methods to run a local server:

### Using Python (easiest)
```bash
# If you have Python installed:
# Navigate to the project directory, then run:
python -m http.server
# Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

### Using Node.js
```bash
# If you have Node.js installed:
# Navigate to the project directory, then run:
npx serve
# Then open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal
```

### Using PHP
```bash
# If you have PHP installed:
# Navigate to the project directory, then run:
php -S localhost:8000
# Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

## Deployment

This site is designed to be easily deployed to GitHub Pages:

1. Push the repository to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (Settings > Pages)
3. Select the main branch as the source
